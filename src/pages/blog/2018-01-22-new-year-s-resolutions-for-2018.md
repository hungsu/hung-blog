In 2017, I can't think of anything interesting I made that I'd want to show anyone. I hate that - so this year, I want to learn to make as many things as possible. 26 in fact - one for every fortnight this year. In no particular order, I've chosen these things to learn to do

* Solder a keybaord
* Make eggs benedict
* Make palabok - Filipino noodles
* Make pho - Vietnamese noodles
* Make cha gio - vietnamese spring rolls
* Make ramen - Japanese noodles
* Make cocktails
* Make a pair of speakers
* Learn to swim
* Run 5km without stopping
* How to aerial (no hand cartwheel)
* Make an Android app
* Sharpen a knife
* Get a job interview at Valve
* Make a rolling table
* How to give massages
* Alter my own clothes
* Paraglide
