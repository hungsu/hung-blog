description: Why I'm drifting away from Facebook to start this blog.
---
Facebook is becoming a valueless mess. The very occasional happy glimmering moments of our friends' lives is drowned out by poorly articulated political shitposts, advertising, Gfycats, square videos with unnecessary captions on the top and bottom, and other rabble. It's very rare that I feel like something on Facebook has made my life better.

Not only this, but I find myself not wanting to post anything of my own on Facebook. Facebook's like system works as a way of crowdsourced curation - like someone's posts to encourage them to post more. But I find myself wanting to write and post about my boring and dark moments, because those moments are often pivotal to the brighter moments. The dark boring moments that no one likes, and I can't help but feel like I'm wasting other people's time when I post something no one Likes. I often find myself deleting anything that people don't Like, and in a way I think this is me not being completely open and honest with myself.

I need somewhere I can be completely open, and hence I'm starting another blog here. No likes, no comments, just completely open and honest Hung-Su.
