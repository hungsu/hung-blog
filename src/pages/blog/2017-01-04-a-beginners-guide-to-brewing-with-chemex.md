# Why solder my own keyboard?

I've used many keyboard over the years, each one bought usually to deal with the frustrations of the previous keyboard. My first "weird" keyboard was this - a Wolf Claw keyboard.

Weird as it looks, I found it incredibly comfortable to use - the giant vertical space bar on the left made jumping in FPS games easy, the curved number row made weapon selection easy, and in general was a fantastic FPS gaming keyboard. Except for one problem. When playing games, I could not press Shift, A, W, and R all at the same time. Or more specifically, if I was running diagonally in Counter Strike, I could not reload my gun. That frustration led me to start building a list of requirements in my dream keyboard.

## 1. Must have NKRO

This is a mechanical keyboard with NKRO - that is, you could press any number of keys and it would know what you pressed. In addition, I deliberately chose a keyboard with the legend printed on the front, with the thought that I would use the keyboard forever so the legend would last forever. Boy I was wrong about that.

I learned about the idea of "endgame". One keyboard that I would never want to replace, and keep until my dying day.

## 2. Must be quiet

## 3. Must not have input lag

## 4. Must be programmable

iGK64

## 5. Should look fantastic.

So with all those requirements, it was time for me to 

# Building the dream keyboard

## Planning

## Assembly

## Programming

Wasted absurd amount of hours following group buys, even bought and sold a iGK64

Ordered keyboard long ago

Went to keyboard workshop

Made QMK firmware with qmkeyboard.cn

Now that I had made some firmware, I had to flash the keyboard with it. This took more Googling than I care to admit, but in the end it required me to do the following:

1. Download and install QMK Toolkit
2. Unplug my keyboard, press and hold Spacebar+B while plugging it in again to start it in bootloader mode
3. Open my firmware in QMK Toolkit, then hit Flash

# Next steps

As much as I enjoy this keyboard, I still have not achieved my vision of a perfect keyboard. So what's wrong with it?

## My keycaps look cheap and goofy.

I find it hard to read the legends on this one and the mismatched heights are annoying me a lot. So I'd be looking to buy a replacement set of keycaps that will last a long time. Something like this:

## Pressing the keys feels slightly rattly or scratchy.

This can be solved by lubricating the switches and stabilisers with industrial lubricant - an IMMENSELY time consuming exercise. I've heard people also talk about "snipping" stabilisers, and upgrading them to "screw-in stabilisers". I don't know what this means but if itmakes pressing my Spacebar/Shift/Enter nicer, I'll do it.
