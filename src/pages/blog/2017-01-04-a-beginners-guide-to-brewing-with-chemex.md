# But why?

My first "weird" keyboard was this - a Wolf Claw keyboard.

Weird as it looks, I found it incredibly comfortable to use - the giant vertical space bar on the left made jumping in FPS games easy, the curved number row made weapon selection easy, and in general was a fantastic FPS gaming keyboard. Except for one problem. When playing games, I could not press Shift, A, W, and R all at the same time. Or more specifically, if I was running diagonally in Counter Strike, I could not reload my gun. That frustration led me to buy this in 2011:

I deliberately chose a keyboard with the legend printed on the front, with the thought that I would use the keyboard forever so the legend would last forever. Boy I was wrong about that.

Ordered keyboard long ago

Went to keyboard workshop
