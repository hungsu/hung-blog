# Why solder my own keyboard?

I've used many keyboard over the years, each one bought usually to deal with the frustrations of the previous keyboard. My first "weird" keyboard was this - a Wolf Claw keyboard.

Weird as it looks, I found it incredibly comfortable to use - the giant vertical space bar on the left made jumping in FPS games easy, the curved number row made weapon selection easy, and in general was a fantastic FPS gaming keyboard. Except for one problem. When playing games, I could not press Shift, A, W, and R all at the same time. Or more specifically, if I was running diagonally in Counter Strike, I could not reload my gun. That frustration led me to buy this in 2011:

This is a mechanical keyboard with NKRO - that is, you could press any number of keys and it would know what you pressed. In addition, I deliberately chose a keyboard with the legend printed on the front, with the thought that I would use the keyboard forever so the legend would last forever. Boy I was wrong about that.

I learned about the idea of "endgame". One keyboard that I would never want to replace, and keep until my dying day.

As much as I enjoy this keyboard, I still have not achieved my vision of a perfect keyboard. So what's wrong with it?

## Keycaps look cheap and goofy.

I find it hard to read the legends on this one and the mismatched heights are annoying me a lot. So I'd be looking to buy a replacement set of keycaps that will last a long time. Something like this:

## Pressing the keys feels slightly scratchy.

This can be solved by lubricating the switches and stabilisers with industrial lubricant - an IMMENSELY time consuming exercise. 

## It's not portable
